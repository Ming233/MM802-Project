# Bitcoin prediction visualization platform

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

Before you run this code you need install all requirement package first:

All required packages are embeded into the Package.Json.

### `npm install/yarn`

In the project directory, you can run: npm install or yarn to install all required pageckages

### `yarn start`

User must navigate to the server folder to run yarn start to start the NodeJS server.

The next step is to navigate to the client folder to run yarn start to start the React.

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `Web Demo pages`

Once the web is successfully hosted, you should be able to navigate and see the following pages.

### `About this web app`

This React website visualize predicted Bitcoin price into a graphical, user-friendly charts to the user. In this way, potential investor can make up their decision by checking different models' price trend.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Data

The [Hashrate and historical price data](https://www.quandl.com/data/BCHAIN-Blockchain) relies on data from quandl website

## Files

All coding file is listed under the src folder, for each file it will have a short document at the top of each file. You will also
be able to find comments explain each block of code. All multimedia resources are stroged under public folder.
